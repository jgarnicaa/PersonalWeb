For example, the amount of data that can be extracted from tweets about a specific topic or the information publicly shared by users on specialized forums. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be incredible to use this data to quantify, analyze, and even train a specialized LLM (Large Language Model) on a specific topic? Well, that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what web scraping does! It allows you to retrieve and explore data from websites, making it possible to extract valuable information for further use.\n🕰️ When to Use Web Scraping? #Web scraping should be used when you have publicly available data on a website that is of interest to you. This means information that is freely shared and accessible. It should not be used on private websites or those handling personal or sensitive data, such as pages requiring login credentials or access to private information.\nWeb scraping is ideal for:\nPublic blogs Social media platforms (with public data) Open forums For example, I used web scraping in my LLM Poetry Generator project to gather data from a Spanish poetry website. The available datasets online were too small, so I decided to scrape my own. Keep reading to learn how I did it! 😊\n🛠️ How to Use Web Scraping? #To understand web scraping, it\u0026rsquo;s important to classify websites into two types:\nDynamic Websites: Like social media platforms, which use varied structures to share information. Static Websites: Like blogs, which use HTML to describe their content. In this guide, we\u0026rsquo;ll focus on static websites since they are easier to scrape.\n📄 A Quick Introduction to HTML #To scrape data effectively, you need to understand how HTML structures content. HTML uses tags to define different parts of a webpage, such as titles, body text, images, external links, etc. Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick example of HTML tags:\n\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;This is a Title\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is a paragraph.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://example.com\u0026#34;\u0026gt;This is a link\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;image.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;An image\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Understanding these tags is crucial because they help you identify where the data you want to scrape is located on the webpage.\n🔍 Extracting the Data #Once you understand HTML tags and the structure of your target website, you can start extracting data. However, web scraping is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Each website is unique, and your scraping approach must be adapted to the specific structure of the site.\nLet me walk you through an example: I scraped approximately 13,000 Spanish poems from the website www.poemas-del-alma.com. Here\u0026rsquo;s how I did it:\nStep 1: Explore the Website Structure\nI started by analyzing the website\u0026rsquo;s structure. I noticed that I needed to:\nFirst, retrieve a list of authors. Then, get the list of poem titles for each author. Finally, extract the text of each poem using the author and title information. Step 2: Extract Authors\nUsing the browser\u0026rsquo;s Developer Tools (F12), I inspected the HTML and found that the \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; tag contained the links to individual authors. I used this tag to extract all author links.\nStep 3: Extract Poem Titles\nFor each author, I accessed their page and extracted the poem titles. I noticed that poem links were the only ones containing \u0026quot;https\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;.htm\u0026quot;, so I filtered out other links.\nStep 4: Extract Poem Text\nFinally, I looped through each poem link and extracted the text using the \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; tag, which contained the poem\u0026rsquo;s body.\n🧰 Tools for Web Scraping #For static websites, I used Python along with the BeautifulSoup library to implement the scraping script. Here\u0026rsquo;s a breakdown of the tools I used:\nPython: The programming language used for scripting. BeautifulSoup: A Python library for parsing HTML and extracting data. Requests: A library to send HTTP requests and retrieve webpage content. You can check out the full script I used for scraping poems on my GitHub repository:\n🔗 Web Scraping Script 📊 Bonus: The Dataset #If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in exploring the dataset I created, you can find it on Kaggle:\n🔗 Spanish Poetry Dataset\n🚀 Conclusion #Web scraping is a powerful technique for extracting data from websites, especially when publicly available datasets are insufficient. By understanding HTML structure and using tools like Python and BeautifulSoup, you can gather and analyze data for various applications, such as training machine learning models or conducting research.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re new to web scraping, start with static websites and gradually explore more complex scraping techniques.

Artificial intelligence models have become a key tool in our daily lives, enhancing productivity and even serving as a source of recreation.\nAs a poetry lover, I wanted to combine these two passions: the ancient art of poetry and the cutting-edge technology of AI. This project was born out of my desire to find inspiration for writing my own poetry. 😊\nIn this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through the stages of the project, from data acquisition to web deployment. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep it concise and not too technical—this is more of a personal recount than a step-by-step manual. Enjoy!\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to check out the repository for more technical details: 🔗 GenAI Project 📂 Data Acquisition #To train the model, I needed a large dataset of poems in both English and Spanish. For English, I found a suitable dataset on Kaggle. However, for Spanish, the available datasets were either too small or incomplete. So, I decided to scrape a poetry website to gather my own dataset. You can read more about the web scraping process in my Web Scraping blog post.\nIn the end, I had:\n14,000 poems in English 13,000 poems in Spanish 🧹 Data Cleaning #Having the data was just the first step. Ensuring its quality was crucial. I faced several questions during this phase:\nShould I clean spaces and line breaks? Should I remove stopwords? How should I normalize the data? To answer these questions, I focused on the final product I wanted to deliver: a model that generates a poem based on a prompt (the first line) and produces up to 200 words in a single stanza, with proper line breaks for aesthetic appeal.\nThe cleaning process involved:\nNormalizing line breaks. Dropping excessively long or short poems. Ensuring the final output had the necessary line breaks for readability. 🤖 Model Selection and Training #I chose GPT-2 for fine-tuning because it is lightweight, easy to fine-tune, and deployable without requiring extensive computational resources. Since my hardware was limited, I used Google Colab for training, leveraging the Hugging Face library to load the pre-trained GPT-2 model and fine-tune it with my dataset. The training process took approximately 7 hours.\n🚀 Model Deployment #I wanted the model to be accessible to everyone, so I decided to deploy it as a web application. Here\u0026rsquo;s how I did it:\nBackend: Built with FastAPI. Frontend: Developed using Streamlit. Containerization: Packaged the application into a Docker container. Deployment: Used AWS EC2 to host the application, making it publicly accessible. 📊 Results #The results were promising! The model generates coherent and creative poems based on the input prompt. However, there was a minor issue: the model sometimes mixed English and Spanish in the output. This happened because I didn\u0026rsquo;t add a language tag during data preprocessing. Regenerating the poem with the same prompt usually fixed the issue.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example of a poem generated in English:\n🌟 Conclusion #This project was a fascinating journey into the intersection of art and technology. By combining my love for poetry with the power of AI, I created a tool that can inspire and generate beautiful poems. While there are still improvements to be made, the results are already impressive.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in exploring the project further, check out the GitHub repository and try out the web application!\n📌 Tags ##LLM #GenAI #Poetry #MachineLearning #WebDeployment #GPT2 #HuggingFace\n","date":"26 February 2025","permalink":"/projects/genai/","section":"Projects","summary":"An AI writing poetry?
