Strigoo is a sensor developed for detecting road actors such as pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles. This opportunity allowed me to combine my final year of university studies with professional work, gaining hands-on experience in embedded systems and deep learning.\nThe goal was to implement a deep learning algorithm that would be more robust in detecting road actors. However, the hardware limitations posed a significant challenge: 1MB of RAM! This constraint required innovative solutions to optimize the algorithm and make it feasible for deployment on embedded systems.\nüõ†Ô∏è Key Contributions #1. Algorithm Optimization #To address the hardware limitations, I implemented several optimization techniques:\nBinarization: Reduced the complexity of image processing. Morphological Operations: Improved image quality by removing noise and enhancing shapes. Image Filters: Applied various filters to make images lighter and faster to process. 2. Deep Learning Architectures #I explored and tested several neural network architectures to find the most efficient solution:\nYOLOv8: Known for its real-time object detection capabilities. FOMO: A lightweight model optimized for embedded systems. MobileNetV2: Designed for mobile and embedded devices with limited resources. Custom Network: A tailored architecture designed specifically for this project. 3. Model Training and Deployment # Trained the models using a dataset of labeled images. Exported the models using TensorFlow Lite for deployment on embedded systems. Achieved an accuracy of 92% with the custom network. Implemented pruning and quantization techniques to reduce the model size to under 1MB, making it suitable for the microcontroller\u0026rsquo;s limited resources. üìä Results # Accuracy: Achieved 92% accuracy in detecting road actors. Model Size: Reduced the model size to under 1MB using pruning and quantization. Deployment: Successfully implemented the model on the embedded system, enabling real-time detection. üéì Skills Acquired #This experience allowed me to develop a wide range of skills, including:\nDeep Learning: Understanding of neural network architectures, training, and optimization. Computer Vision: Techniques for image processing and object detection. Embedded Systems: Working with hardware constraints and optimizing algorithms for resource-limited environments.

During my 4-month internship, I was recruited as a stagiaire to work on improving the detection algorithm for a sensor designed to classify public road actors, such as pedestrians, cars, motorcycles, bicycles, and more, using a camera and image data analysis.\nüéØ Project Overview #The goal of the project was to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the sensor\u0026rsquo;s detection algorithm. The sensor is an embedded system, meaning the algorithm had to run locally without relying on cloud processing. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the project evolved:\nInitial Approach #The initial algorithm used a decision tree based on differences between consecutive frames. Parameters such as object size, elongation, density, and curvature were used to define thresholds for classifying each type of actor. However, this method only achieved an accuracy of 55%, which was not robust enough for real-world applications.\nüõ†Ô∏è My Role and Contributions #As the lead developer for this algorithm, I proposed and implemented a supervised learning approach to improve its performance. Here\u0026rsquo;s a breakdown of my work:\n1. Data Collection #I began by collecting a substantial dataset of road actors. This involved manually creating a table where each object was described by its characteristics. For example:\nObject Area Elongation Density Curvature \u0026hellip; Car 4500 75 80 20 \u0026hellip; Pedestrian 850 90 90 0 \u0026hellip; Motorcycle 1200 85 70 15 \u0026hellip; Bicycle 600 80 60 10 \u0026hellip; This table represented each object as a vector based on pixel differences between frames caused by their movement, 2000 objects were registered.\n2. Model Training #Using this dataset, I trained and compared several supervised learning algorithms. The Random Forest model emerged as the best performer, achieving an accuracy of 85%‚Äîa significant improvement over the initial decision tree.\n3. Data Annotation for Future Improvements #To further enhance the algorithm, I collected and labeled a dataset of 5,000 images featuring various road actors. I used Roboflow, an open-source platform, to manage and version these images in the cloud. This dataset laid the groundwork for future implementations of deep learning models to achieve even higher performance.\nüñºÔ∏è Example Image #Here‚Äôs an example of the labeled images used for training:\nüöÄ Results and Impact #By the end of my internship, I had successfully:\nImproved the algorithm\u0026rsquo;s accuracy from 55% to 85% using Random Forest. Created a robust dataset of 5,000 labeled images for future deep learning implementations. Set the stage for transitioning to more advanced models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to further enhance performance. üåü Key Takeaways #This internship allowed me to:\nGain hands-on experience in machine learning and embedded systems. Develop skills in data collection, model training, and performance optimization. Work in a collaborative environment to solve real-world problems. üìå Tags ##Engineering #MachineLearning #EmbeddedSystems #ComputerVision #Internship #Occion\n","date":"1 June 2023","permalink":"/exp/occion/","section":"Exps","summary":"Machine Learning Internship on Embedded Systems","title":"Summer Internship"},{"content":"üéì National University of Colombia #üîó Mechatronics Engineering Program Website #The National University of Colombia is the most prestigious and largest university in the country.
