# Work-Study Program (Alternance)

## üöÄ Overview

After completing my internship at **Occion**, the company that had subcontracted me, **Keyia**, offered me a position in their work-study program (alternance) to continue advancing the **Strigoo** project. Strigoo is a sensor developed for detecting road actors such as pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles. This opportunity allowed me to combine my final year of university studies with professional work, gaining hands-on experience in embedded systems and deep learning.

The goal was to implement a **deep learning algorithm** that would be more robust in detecting road actors. However, the hardware limitations posed a significant challenge: **1MB of RAM**! This constraint required innovative solutions to optimize the algorithm and make it feasible for deployment on embedded systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Contributions

### 1. **Algorithm Optimization**
To address the hardware limitations, I implemented several optimization techniques:
- **Binarization**: Reduced the complexity of image processing.
- **Morphological Operations**: Improved image quality by removing noise and enhancing shapes.
- **Image Filters**: Applied various filters to make images lighter and faster to process.

### 2. **Deep Learning Architectures**
I explored and tested several neural network architectures to find the most efficient solution:
- **YOLOv8**: Known for its real-time object detection capabilities.
- **FOMO**: A lightweight model optimized for embedded systems.
- **MobileNetV2**: Designed for mobile and embedded devices with limited resources.
- **Custom Network**: A tailored architecture designed specifically for this project.

### 3. **Model Training and Deployment**
- Trained the models using a dataset of labeled images.
- Exported the models using **TensorFlow Lite** for deployment on embedded systems.
- Achieved an accuracy of **92%** with the custom network.
- Implemented **pruning** and **quantization** techniques to reduce the model size to under **1MB**, making it suitable for the microcontroller's limited resources.
